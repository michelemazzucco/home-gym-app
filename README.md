## The problem

Many of us have home gym equipment, but finding workout plans that actually use what we own is surprisingly difficult. Most online plans either leave some equipment gathering dust or push you to buy more gear, cluttering up your garage or living room even more.

## My solution

Create personalized workout plans based on your actual equipment. 

But let's be honest‚Äîsometimes we're too lazy to list everything we have. That's where AI comes into play: simply scan your equipment and get a tailored, effective workout plan designed around what you already own.

## Mobile PWA
The app works on mobile as well, giving you the chance to actually take the picture from the app.
